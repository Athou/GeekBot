Create a new command--------------------Create a new class anywhere (it will be picked up automatically) and annotate it with the [`@BotCommand`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/annotations/BotCommand.html) annotation.Then add a `public` method returning either a `String`, a `List<String>`, or `void`. Annotate it with either [`@Trigger`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/annotations/Trigger.html), [`@RandomAction`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/annotations/RandomAction.html) or [`@TimedAction`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/annotations/TimedAction.html). Check the available arguments for those annotations in the javadoc or directly in the source code.The method should accept either a [`TriggerEvent`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/bot/TriggerEvent.html) object as argument or no argument at all. The [`TriggerEvent`](apidocs/be/hehehe/geekbot/bot/TriggerEvent.html)  object contains data about the event that triggered the command, such as the message and the author.That's it. Now just code the body of your method, restart the bot and you're done!
